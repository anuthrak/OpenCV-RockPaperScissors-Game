## OpenCV Rock Paper Scissors
This is a real-time Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python that detects your hand gesture through a webcam and plays against the computer. 

It utillizes python's Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) for video processing and Google's MediaPipe (via cvzone) for real-time hand tracking.

#### Install dependencies (libraries):

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install mediapipe

# OR install them all at once

pip install opencv-python cvzone mediapipe
```

#### Run the project:

```bash
# Run your python file name: yourfile.py

python rockpaperscissors.py
```
